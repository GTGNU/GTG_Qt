Richard Stallman (RMS) is a programmer and hobbyist hacker whose only love in life is freedom. He dreams of a world in which the user has control and is able to change software to fit his needs. What stands in his way is the large and evil Corps such as Microshaft and, Crapple. People such as Billy Fence (the owner of Microshaft), Stephen Works (of Crapple), Mark Rocketvalue (of Ubongo) and, Steven Sphearmor (also from Microshaft) are out to stop our hero RMS. In this game the goal is to free the world and take down the large corps. You team up with people such as Richard Greenblatt, Tom Knight, Bill Gosper, Eric S. Raymond and, Linus Torvalds just to name a few.

In this frantic top view action game, you will be fighting off waves of code monkeys, proprietary bosses and hack into systems all while defending the rights of the user and hackers everywhere. YOU’LL BE FREE HACKERS! YOU’LL BE FREE!

Slowly, you open your eyes and look over at the screen.
“What is this about?” you think.
Sitting down at the desk, you see that its an Email from Eric Raymond
>contents of Email
 
                Hey RMS,
                        Hows GNU (GUH-NEW) coming? I've heard some great things about it and can't wait to
                        see it for my self. Keep me posted and let me know if you need any help.
 
                                                                                        Eric
That was nice of him but, this is something I need to do my self.
 
>cut scene of RMS coding madly
>He finishes and gets up.
>There's a ringing on the phone, it's Richard Greenblatt
 
RMS: “Hello?”
Richard: “Hey, It's me.”
RMS: “Oh, how have you been?”
Richard: “Good, and you? I've heard good stuff about GNU (GUH-NEW).”
>You remain silent.
Richard: “Ok, fair enough, you don't have to tell me about it.” he chuckles “Why don't you come down to the lab today. Some of the guys got a hold of one of those “Apple Lisa” machines and we’re going to give it a run, see what we can do with it.”
RMS: “Really? Neat, I’ll be there soon.”

####### Lab #######
 
>>starts auto pilot<<
Theres a group of people huddled around a computer, you walk over to take a look
you see Tom Knight, Eric Raymond, Bil Gosper and Richard.
 
>Richard: “Oh, good. You’re here, Stallman. Take a look at this! Protected memory, cooperative multitasking, more sophisticated hard disk, a built-in screen saver, an advanced calculator with a paper tape and RPN, support for up to 2 megabytes of RAM, expansion slots, a numeric keypad, data corruption protection, non-physical file names, high-res display. It’s not bad, but we're better.”
>>everyone chuckels<<
>RMS: “What have you done with it so far?”
>Richard: “Nothing yet but, we’ve found some bugs. The LisaClac doesn’t restore the the cell
correctly if you cancel the operation. We’ll see what they do about it.”
>>Tom Knight speaks up<<
>Tom: “Over all, it's nice. I could use something like this in my lab.”
>Richard: “Too bad it costs ten grand.”
>RMS: “I wouldn’t buy one of these if I were the richest man in the world. What is the point of all of that 
“innovation” if the source is locked up in a vault some where. We might be able to fix the bugs if we could see how it ran.”
>>everyone nods in agreement<<

        >There is a large chair with its back turned, we can see        
        hands of the man in the chair.
        >An intern comes into the room with a file in his hands.
>Intern: “S-sir?”
>>the man presses a button on the intercom<<
>CEO: “Sarah.”
>>secretary answers<<
>Sarah: “Yes, sir?”
>CEO: “I do believe that I told you I did not wish to be disturbed.”
>Sarah: “Yes sir, but...”
>>she is cut off by the man<<
>CEO: “Sarah...”
>Sarah: “Yes sir.”
>CEO: “Don’t ever let it happen again.”
>Sarah: “Yes sir.”
>>the man motions for the intern to come closer<<
>CEO: “What is it?”
>Intern: “I- uh, I thought...”
>CEO: “What did you think? I hope you didn't think too hard. You could hurt your self. 
Tell me what you want and get out.”
>Intern: “I- I have the information that you requested, sir.”
>CEO: “And? What does it say?”
>Intern: “Here's the file sir.”
>CEO: “Is that what I asked? Did I say “Give me the file"? I told you to tell me what it says.”
>Intern: “I- it... Well...”
>>the man slams his fist on the desk<<
>CEO: “DO NOT WASTE MY TIME!! WHAT DOES IT SAY?!?”
>Intern: “There's been rumors that there is a man working on a “free” software. We don’t have all the data-”
>>the man spins around in the chair, his face obscured by shadow<<
>CEO: “GET OUT OF MY OFFICE! IF YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO TELL ME WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH IT THEN LEAVE NOW! FOREVER! 
GET A BOX AND LEAVE! YOU DO NOT WASTE MY TIME! YOU DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME COMING UP HERE TO TELL ME THAT YOU HEARD 
“RUMORS” AND DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ELSE! GET OUT NOW”
>>he picks up the lamp on the desk and throws it at the intern missing him slightly. It smashes on the wall. The intern 
flees the room.<<

>>A person walks in to the lab and up to RMS<<
>Eric Raymond: “Still playing with that slave machine?”
>RMS: “It's like being told what you can and can't do. It’s just wrong. I feel like I’m in a jail cell just looking at this code.”
>Eric: “Well, forget about that. There's something you need to see.”
>RMS: “What is it?”
