######background######

Richard Stallman (RMS) is a programmer and hobbyist hacker whose only love in life is freedom. He dreams of a world in which the user has control and is able to change software to fit his needs. What stands in his way is the large and evil Corps such as Microshaft and, Crapple. People such as Billy Fence (the owner of Microshaft), Stephen Works (of Crapple), Mark Rocketvalue (of Ubongo) and, Steven Sphearmor (also from Microshaft) are out to stop our hero RMS. In this game the goal is to free the world and take down the large corps. You team up with people such as Richard Greenblatt, Tom Knight, Bill Gosper, Eric S. Raymond and, Linus Torvalds just to name a few.

In this frantic top view action game, you will be fighting off waves of code monkeys, proprietary bosses and hack into systems all while defending the rights of the user and hackers everywhere. YOU’LL BE FREE HACKERS! YOU’LL BE FREE!

                Hey RMS,
                        Hows GNU (GUH-NEW) coming? I've heard some great things about it and can't wait to
                        see it for my self. Keep me posted and let me know if you need any help.
 
                                                                                        Eric
That was nice of him but, this is something I need to do my self.

RMS: “Hello?”
Richard: “Hey, It's me.”
RMS: “Oh, how have you been?”
Richard: “Good, and you? I've heard good stuff about GNU (GUH-NEW).”
>You remain silent.
Richard: “Ok, fair enough, you don't have to tell me about it.” he chuckles “Why don't you come down to the lab today. Some of the guys got a hold of one of those “Apple Lisa” machines and we’re going to give it a run, see what we can do with it.”
RMS: “Really? Neat, I’ll be there soon.”

Theres a group of people huddled around a computer, you walk over to take a look
you see Tom Knight, Eric Raymond, Bil Gosper and Richard.
 
>Richard: “Oh, good. You’re here, Stallman. Take a look at this! Protected memory, cooperative multitasking, more sophisticated hard disk, a built-in screen saver, an advanced calculator with a paper tape and RPN, support for up to 2 megabytes of RAM, expansion slots, a numeric keypad, data corruption protection, non-physical file names, high-res display. It’s not bad, but we're better.”
>>everyone chuckels<<
>RMS: “What have you done with it so far?”
>Richard: “Nothing yet but, we’ve found some bugs. The LisaClac doesn’t restore the the cell
correctly if you cancel the operation. We’ll see what they do about it.”
>>Tom Knight speaks up<<
>Tom: “Over all, it's nice. I could use something like this in my lab.”
>Richard: “Too bad it costs ten grand.”
>RMS: “I wouldn’t buy one of these if I were the richest man in the world. What is the point of all of that 
“innovation” if the source is locked up in a vault some where. We might be able to fix the bugs if we could see how it ran.”
>>everyone nods in agreement<<

Tell me what you want and get out.”
