 RMS is a programmer and hobbyist hacker whose only love in life is freedom. He dreams of a world in witch the user has control and is able to change software to fit his needs. What stands in his way is the large and evil Corps such as Microshaft and, Crapple. People such as Billy Fence (the owner of Microshaft), Stephen Works (of Crapple), Mark Rocketvalue (of ubongo) and, Steven Sphearmor (also from Microshaft) are out to stop our hero RMS. In this game the goal is to free the world and take down the large corps. You team up with people such as Richard Greenblatt, Tom Knight, Bill Gosper, Eric S. Raymond and, Linus Torvalds just to name a few.

	In this top view action packed you will fight off waves of code monkies, fight bosses and, hack into systems all while defending the rights of the user and hackers every where. YOU’LL BE FREE HACKERS! YOU’LL BE FREE!

Slowly, you open your eyes and look over at the screen.
“What is this about?” you think.
Sitting down at the desk, you see that its an Email from Eric Raymond

                Hey RMS,
                        Hows GNU (GUH-NEW) coming? I've heard some good things about it and can't wait to
                        see it for my self. Keep me posted and let me know if you need any help.
 
                                                                                        Eric
That was nice of him but, this is something I need to do my self.

RMS: “Hello?”
Richard: “Hey, It's me.”
RMS: “Oh, how have you been?”
Richard: “Good, and you? I've heard good stuff about GNU (GUH-NEW).”
>You remain silent.
Richard: “Ok, fair enough, you don't have to tell me about it.” he chuckles “Why don't you come down to the lab today. Some of the guys got a hold of one of those “Apple lisa” machines and we’re going to give it a run, see what we can do with it.”
RMS: “Really? Neat, I’ll be there soon.”

>>starts auto pilot<<
theres a group of people huddled around a computer, you walk over to take a look
you see Tom Knight, Eric Raymond, Bil Gosper and Richard.

>Richard: “Oh good you’re here Stallman. Take a look at this! Protected memory, cooperative multitasking, more sophisticated hard disk, a built-in screensaver, an advanced calculator with a paper tape and RPN, support for up to 2 megabytes of RAM, expansion slots, a numeric keypad, data corruption protection, non-physical file names, high res display. It’s not bad.But, we’re better.”
>>everyone chuckels<<
>RMS: “what have you done to it so far?”
>Richard: “Nothing yet but, we’ve found some bugs. The LisaClac doesn’t restore the the cell 
correctly if you cancel the operation. We’ll see what they do about it.”
>>Tom Knight speaks up<<
>Tom: “Over all its nice. I could use something like this in my lab.”
>Richard: “Too bad it
