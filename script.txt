
RMS is a coder out to destroy proprietary software. Balmer (the anti-hero) dose not share RMS's philosophy and aims to silence RMS.

*RMS (you) are working at MIT, you give speeches about the use of free and open software. Ballmer is looking for a new supervisor. He claims that he supports the open source movement. 
*The uni begins to loose money due to new product and (you) begin to worry that people will not be able to hear your talks and therefore not be able to spread you believes about "FOSS".
*(you) are back in the lab, sulking over this tragic set back. Errors start appearing on your terminal, NVIDIA. you try to desperately to fix them. coding as fast as you can but to no avail. 
*falling over from exhaustion, drenched in sweat, you see a figure in the door way but, you cannot see who it is. your vision is blurry and you begin to black out. there is a laugh coming from some where but you cannot place it. #black out#
*you wake up in a hospital bed with wires and tubes sticking out of you. A cyborg joke crosses your mind but there are more important things to think about. who was that person you saw? who was laughing? why were there so many errors?
*knowing what failed (the NVIDIA (what ever we decides that failed)) you decide that you will get to the bottom of it. even if you have to go all the way to the top of NVIDIA.
*several calls and emails later (and talking to people in your lab) you discover that it was not NVIDIA's fault. Maybe its their rivals ATI who are to blame.
*while working in the lab again you hear the subtle buzz or a pager by the door and once again see the shadowy figure. you quickly look up and shout "who is it?!". realizing they have been spotted the figure darts out of the door way. you quickly get up and chase after them but they disappear before you make it out of the hallway. walking back to the lab you notice a key card on the ground it reads "ATI HQ" across the top.
*you decide to check it out and while at there you meet Logan from teksyndicate. after talking to some people you discover that ballmer has turned to proprietary software. after more research you find that he has bought out ATI.

"Stallman, wake up!"
>you wake up
You find yourself covered in stale cheetos from a long night of reading troll emails from /g/.
>you look at the clock, it's 2 in the afternoon
"What the hell! I'm not supposed to wake up for another 2 hours and twenty minutes, this better be fucking important!" You say. 
>you shift over to look at shota-linus who woke you up. 
"IT IS IMPORTANT! Ubuntu's gone proprietary." He says
"WHAT! That's against the liscense!"
"They found a loophole somehow. They're going to bring linux to the masses in proprietary form!"
"What do they think this is, BSD?"


>shota-linus helps RMS out of bed 
"Quick, Linus boot up my Lemote!" You say.
"But that'll take forever!" He replies.
>RMS boots it up anyway
>after 30 minutes, the ancient machine dimly displays the gNewSense logo 
>RMS spends the next 3 hours checking emails
shota-linus tugs your beard 
"They're uploading the proprietary version in an hour!" He says 
You look at your inbox and, despite the fact that you still have over 300 unread e-mails, you nod your head.
"Start up your piece of junk, then."
shota-linus starts up the laptop that some company paid him 10 dollars to write a good review about. It boots in 7 seconds, and the walk out the door. 
"Hey, Stallman, if we're such great programmers and developers, why do we do most of our stuff on shitty laptops?"
>you remain silent.




>starts in RMS's apartment
>announcement of Ubuntu kicks every thing off
>stallman decides to take action against the makers of ubuntu
>you go to the convention
>see all the ubuntu platforms
>you leave
>you return to the apartment 
>discuss what happened and wonder what should be done about it
