		"\n*(you) are back in the lab, sulking over this tragic set back. Errors start appearing on your terminal, NVIDIA. you try to desperately to fix them. coding as fast as you can but to no avail."

		"\n*several calls and emails later (and talking to people in your lab) you discover that it was not NVIDIA's fault. Maybe its their rivals ATI who are to blame."
		"\n*while working in the lab again you hear the subtle buzz or a pager by the door and once again see the shadowy figure. you quickly look up and shout 'who is it?!'. realizing they have been spotted the figure darts out of the door way. you quickly get up and chase after them but they disappear before you make it out of the hallway. walking back to the lab you notice a key card on the ground it reads 'ATI HQ' across the top."
		"\n*you decide to check it out and while at there you meet Logan from teksyndicate. after talking to some people you discover that ballmer has turned to proprietary software. after more research you find that he has bought out ATI.";
