Currently the installation is very simple. The examples in here are directed at linux users.
For other platforms you would have to figure how to compile using makefiles.

REQUIREMENTS:
gcc
sdl
sdl_image
sdl_ttf (for the editor only)

To install the game:

cd Code/GTG/
make clean

Thats it you should get a file named game, copy that to a directory with a res folder (you can find one
in Binaries/res) and run it.

To install the editor: (make sure you have sdl_ttf installed)

cd Code/GTGEditor/
make

You will get the editor binary.
Same thing as you did for the game, you also need the res folder.
