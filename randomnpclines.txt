Guy1: Hey man, I just installed a new Nvidia graphics card and now my computer boots up 1.7% faster!
Guy2: That's pretty cool!
Guy1: Not only that, but I can use it in the morning to cook eggs on it.
Guy1: Man, my computer is really bad, now that I upgraded to a newer version of Proprietarydows...
Guy2: You should go get a Crapple Crapintosh
Guy1: No way, I really dislike System 70
Guy2: You can dualboot Proprietarydows using Boot Tent?
Guy1: Guess I'll check them out then, Thanks!

Guy1: Man, you'll never believe what just happened to me the other day.
Guy2: What?
Guy1: So I wanted to check those new Crapintosh computers at the Crapple store...
Guy2: Go on...
Guy1: And I decided to buy one, but when I reached into my pockets, all I had was spaghetti.
Guy2: Wait...what?
Guy1: So, when I took my hand out of my pocket, the spaghetti fell out onto the floor.
